04/04/22 12:48:58 (pdt03): PER B457 MALE WITH CREAM JACKET WITH HOODY WHITE MASK BLACK SW PANTS WHT AND POSS BLACK SNEAKERS. HIGH HAIR CUT

While en-route, Officer Diaz observed a White Hispanic male walking on Quincy St. (odd # side) towards Blue Hill Ave. The juvenile male was wearing a light blue surgical mask, gray hooded sweatshirt underneath a cream color winter jacket, blue jeans, and tan color high top shoes. The Officer inquired over the police radio if the suspect had been wearing a mask while stopping the marked police car to get out and make a threshold inquiry. The B103D (Joseph/Pina) also stopped to assist Officer Diaz. Upon seeing the uniformed police officers approaching him, the juvenile male threw an empty square plastic tray he had been carrying over a chain link fence next to the gas station (310 Blue Hill Ave). Officer Diaz promptly advised the juvenile male that there had been a report of an armed robbery at the convenience store down the street and the suspect description was of a male wearing a ""hoodie"". The juvenile male was further advised that he was being stopped for this reason, as well as he was walking from the immediate direction of the store in question. The juvenile male denied having been in the store. It should be known that the juvenile male was stopped at approximately 87 Quincy St (Between Dacia & Blue Hill Ave) which is about a 1/4 mile from the store (6 min walk per google maps). During a pat frisk for weapons, Officer Diaz discovered the juvenile male had more than a handful of cigarette lighters in his right coat pocket, and a rock the size of a hockey puck in his left coat pocket. Thinking back to the tray the juvenile male had thrown, the cigarette lighters would have fit in the observed empty slots from that tray. No firearm was discovered. The juvenile male verbally identified himself as ""XXX"" and stated he attends the Compass School. While Officer Diaz was writing down XXXinformation, a radio broadcast went out, repeating that there had been reports that the convenience store was robbed at gunpoint. Upon hearing this, XXXbecame very upset and made the following excited utterance; ""Robbery at GUNPOINT? He's LYING!"" This statement was made by XXXwithout any prompting by the Officers and was captured on BWC. Officer Diaz then confronted XXXabout previously stating he wasn't in the store. XXXthen admitted that he had been in the store and further volunteered; ""I only took the lighters because he was accusing me of stealing something else."" The BK01D (Zukowski/Evangelista) and B911 (Sgt. Ramos) then joined the Officers at the subject stop and Officer Diaz went to run XXXinfo.

While Officer Diaz was checking XXXinfo via CJIS, Officer Hypolite (B457D) on scene at the store was provided with months old video footage of the Suspect and per the B911, based on this undisclosed as months old footage, XXXwas released forthwith due to discrepancies in the description. Afterwards, Officer Diaz responded to the store and at this time, the current CCTV footage from today's active incident was now available. Officer Diaz was able to review today's footage (4/4/2022) and it was clear that the subject from the footage was in fact the same person Officer Diaz had just stopped XXXWhile reviewing the current CCTV footage from the incident on 4/4/2022, XXXcan be seen at the counter for a period of time, followed by reaching into his right coat pocket, removing a bag of merchandise (presumably potato chips) followed by him storming out of the store, grabbing a tray of cigarette lighters and knocking over other merchandise off the counter on his way out.

 Detective Traft exited his home with his BPD radio, badge and firearm to investigate loud music that was blaring through the neighborhood.

 Detective Traft noticed Mass Reg XXX(2008, Gold Honda Accord) parked in front of XXXWoodworth St. The windows were rolled down and there was a W/H/M sitting in the driver side. The music was now off at this point. Detective Traft greeted the male (Believed to be XXX XX/XX/XXXXresides at XXXLorenzo St). Detective Traft said ""What's up my man - is that you with the music?"".

A CJIS query revealed the car to be a rental vehicle (Expressway Motors) recently queried 12 times.

After about five minutes the Officer returned to the area and saw the vehicle still parked illegally and attempted to conduct a stop, however, the car was now unoccupied. The Officer approached on foot and observed a partially smoked blunt in the cupholder, a fanny pack on the passenger seat, and a cell phone that was still illuminated as if it has just been used. The strap of the fanny pack was also stuck in the front passenger door causing it to stay ajar and the car's interior light to stay on.

The Officer was then approached by an individual who exited the building at 965 Blue Hill Ave. The individual was wearing a mask/balaclava that completely covered his head and face and only showed his eyes. The individual refused to identify himself and would not say if the car was his but opened and shut the passenger door to push the strap of the fanny pack fully inside. He continually questioned the Officers' reasoning for investigating the vehicle and stated he was going to call his whole family to come outside to confront the Officer.

The individual asked several times if he was free to go and was told that he was, but still did not leave the area. He seemed overly concerned with the car and the Officers' presence near it and remained talking to the Officer for over ten minutes. The individual eventually stated his name was ""XXX"" and that the rental belonged to his sister XXXWhen asked multiple times why he was so concerned about the car and if there was anything inside of it, the individual stated no but continually looked at the passenger seat/fanny pack area. 

Through Mark 43 and CJIS, the Officer was eventually able to determine that the individual was providing a false ID and was actuallyXXXaka XXX, a well known violent EDP with an open firearm charge and a previous firearm conviction.

Based on the Officers' knowledge of XXXcriminal history and his behavior on scene, a pat frisk was attempted with several B-3 units now present. XXXinitially backed away from Officers and verbally and physically resisted being frisked and was temporarily detained in handcuffs. 

No weapons were located XXXand the fanny pack in the car was empty. A frisk of the rest of vehicle also produced negative results however it should be noted in the future that the vehicle had multiple hidden voids that were easily accessible with little manipulation, despite the car being a 2022 model (underneath the gear shift, behind the radio controls/center console, underneath the dashboard).

A juvenile male was observed in the front passenger seat.

Officer Lydon who was operating the marked Boston Police cruiser (lead vehicle) also observed the same motor vehicle being operated at an unreasonable rate of speed.  Officer Lydon made attempts to slow the driver down by waving his hand, gesturing for her to slow her rate of speed, as he stated audibly to slow down, however, the vehicle barreled by the marked cruiser. At this time the platoon/ recruit officers were marching from the Boston Police Academy parking lot on to Summit Street. Officer Orion then exited the marked cruise and ran around to ensure that the motorist had stopped the motor vehicle. As Officer Orion stood next to the motor vehicle the female appeared to be agitated and she appeared to be speaking, however, it was not audible. As the platoon continued to march onto Summit Street and it appeared that the motorist was going to stand until it was clear for her to proceed, Officer Orion then ran back to the lead cruiser and got back into the passenger seat. However, upon looking back Officers observed the female motorist continued to move her vehicle towards the platoon and the rear cruiser (operated by Officer Owens) that was exiting the parking lot. Sergeant Blake then began to tell the female motorist to stop her vehicle prior to her colliding into the recruits or the rear marked Boston Police cruiser.

The Sergeant, officers, and recruits continued on the morning physical training platoon run. As the platoon reached the corner of Fairmount Avenue and Truman Hwy, the same female inside of the same motor vehicle was observed at the intersection of Truman Hwy and Fairmount Avenue (in bound) proceeding to make a right turn up Fairmount Avenue. At this point the female motorist had her driver’s window down and loud music was emanating from the vehicle. 

Sergeant Blake informed Officer Orion that Officer Owens heard the female motorist, operating the black motor vehicle bearing Massachusetts registration XXXscreaming outside of her driver’s door window, “Fuck the Police”, while using both hands to gesture towards the officers and recruits, her middle fingers.

Per Sergeant Blake, Officer Orion completed an FIO on female motorist."
